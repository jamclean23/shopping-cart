<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
A template for creating apps with Webpack and React.<br/>
This template is modified form the <a href="https://github.com/jamclean23/react-webpack-template">Multiple Page Webpack Template</a> and configured for a single page. 
</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>
Designate folders to be built in webpack.variables.js.<br/>
Javascript index file and html template file need to have the same name as the parent folder.
</p>

<h1>Goals</h1>
<p>
The eventual goal of this project is to take extra work out of setting up a new Webpack/React project, while still being able to use tools normally only compatible with a standard webpack setup.
